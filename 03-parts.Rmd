# Approach/Methodologies

##	Guiding principles

In line with the principles established by the UNFCCC and also in line with Malawi's development goals, the guiding principles for the NAP process are as follows: developing sustainably; uplifting the poor and the vulnerable; respecting the critical role of gender; encouraging participation and ownership; incorporating traditional and Indigenous knowledge and proceeding with financial accountability and integrity.

##	Guidelines used

The main guidelines used included:   

*	The Technical Guidelines for the National Adaptation Plan Process, UNFCCC – this was used as the primary document for framing of the structure and content of the NAP.  It also requires that the NAP process: follows a country-driven, fully transparent, approach; is based on and guided by the best available science and, as appropriate, traditional and indigenous knowledge; and facilitates country-owned, country-driven action and not be prescriptive, nor result in the duplication of efforts undertaken in-country. 
*	Malawi National Climate Change Policy-2017-2027
*	Malawi Second National Communication-2011
*	The Malawi Vision 2063
*	The Malawi Growth Development Strategy 2017-2022
*	Malawi Intended Nationally Determined Contribution
*	National Adaptation Plan of Actions-2006
*	Malawi NAP Stocktaking Report 2016
*	National Climate Change Investment Plan (2013-2018)
*	National Environment and Climate Change Management 2012-2016
*	National Strategy for Sustainable Development
*	Malawi Strategy on Climate Change Learning

In addition, and following the experiences gathered from the implementation of the NAPA process, the Technical Guidelines recommend:  

*	using locally defined criteria for ranking vulnerabilities and prioritizing project activities, which will build confidence and buy-in across all stakeholders; 
*	using available data and assessments as a basis for more comprehensive assessments; and
*	engaging national experts, as this will also enhance the experience and capacity of the country.

These were supported with emerging new data from the published literature. The assessment of these documents together included:

a.	Process of identification/stocktaking of desirable and available information  

i.	Climate and socio-economic data and information
ii.	Current assessments: Exploring possibilities for further assessments
iii.	Policies, strategies, plans
iv.	Existing initiatives on adaptation

b.	Resource mobilization for the process.



##	A systems approach to adaptation

Systems are complex, and each system interacts to various degrees with other related systems.  Sectoral interventions have not been as successful as desired because they do not consider the interactions of system components, including the fact that the mandate to manage some components of the system may lie in a different sector, and hence come under a different institutional mandate whose primary goal is not necessarily in tandem with those of another sector, and more often than not, there is very little synergy between sectoral programmes. 

Urban areas, for example, are complex since many social, physical and economic systems meet and interact, with many of these extending well beyond its spatial boundaries, e.g. water and power supply systems, while other linkages may be transboundary. It is important, therefore, that National Adaptation Plans capture these systems and their interlinkages, scale and stakeholder diversity, so that appropriate and synergistic adaptation measures can be devised and implemented. Thus, the NAP process uses a systems approach which facilitates the integration of climate change adaptation, in a coherent manner, into relevant new and existing policies, programmes and activities, in particular development planning processes and strategies, within all relevant sectors and at different levels, as appropriate.

The framework to guide the assessment of vulnerabilities and risks included:  

i.	Conceptual framework of vulnerability and risk at various levels: national, system level, local level, etc.
ii.	Boundary conditions for the assessment using the period 1971-2000 for baseline climate but also extended further back into time where data is available.
iii.	Focus on key systems/sectors.
iv.	Synergy with SDGs, Sendai Framework for DRR, and other relevant regional and national frameworks.



##	Other unique considerations

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 disrupted globally, established societal structures and ways of doing things, and has had devastating impacts on human health, stressed health systems and severely disrupted national economies. A UNDP 2020 study “Covid-19 Pandemic in Malawi Final Report June 2020” shows the high levels of vulnerabilities of individuals, households and the whole Malawian economy affecting negatively on almost all sectors of the economic growth in the country. The study projects that the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the economy are projected to persist for more than 10 years. The open NAP initiative in Malawi has been developed with Malawi being one of the 11 Africa-Asia-Pacific region beneficiaries of GCF funding of a mitigation-themed project named Climate Investor One. However, more funding of projects from other funding sources like LDCF, SCCF, GEF and Adaptation Fund among other sources has not been materialized perhaps due to lockdowns and poor internet access across the country affecting personnel availability to apply for funding as well as undertake the projects. It is however hoped that the situation will normalize and that COVID-19 will be properly managed so as more funding will be availed to Malawi to continue developing this NAP and more funds can be used to develop the next NAP.


##	Road Map

This particular process was initiated in 2016 with a stakeholder engagement workshop. Milestones in the process are illustrated in Figure 1 below, with the goal of mainstreaming the NAP into the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MDGS III).
